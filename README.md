# Map of Philosophy

A systematic exploration of philosophical arguments using a rigorous testing method grounded in strict logical analysis and necessity.

## Purpose

This repository contains a philosophical map that traces arguments to their logical foundations, following strict principles of reason while avoiding common fallacies. The goal is to analyze philosophical questions with the same rigor and systematic approach that we apply to mathematics and the natural sciences.

## A Rigorous Testing Method

Our approach mimics the disciplined structure of the scientific method to ensure objectivity and guard against confirmation bias. We don't start with a conclusion and seek proof; we start with a skeptical baseline (the Null Hypothesis) and test competing explanations against reason and evidence.

| **Scientific Method**             | **Our Philosophical Method**                                                                                                   |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Observation of Phenomena**      | **Observation of Phenomena** (e.g., existence, consciousness, moral values, logical truths)                                      |
| **Underlying Axioms**             | **Underlying Axioms** (e.g., causality, logical consistency, PSR, the Four Necessities)                                          |
| **Formulate a Hypothesis**        | **Formulate a Hypothesis** (e.g., "A personal, perfect Necessary Being is the ground of reality.")                             |
| **Start with a Null Hypothesis (H₀)** | **Start with a Null Hypothesis (H₀)** (e.g., "The Necessary Being does not exist," or "NB is not personal.")                        |
| **Test the Hypothesis**           | **Test the Hypothesis** (Apply logical analysis, check for internal contradictions, evaluate historical evidence.)               |
| **Analyze the Results**           | **Analyze the Results** (Check for logical fallacies, assess explanatory coherence and parsimony.)                               |
| **Draw a Conclusion**             | **Draw a Conclusion** (Reject or fail to reject H₀ based on the analysis.)                                                         |
| **Peer Review**                   | **Transparent Argumentation** (Lay out all premises, axioms, and logical steps for public critique.)                             |

## Methodological Principles

### Strict Logic
All arguments must follow necessary logical connections. We avoid appeals to intuition or feeling, focusing instead on what can be demonstrated through pure reason.

### Principle of Sufficient Reason
Everything that exists must have a sufficient explanation for why it exists and why it has the properties it does. We reject arbitrary stopping points or "brute facts" that lack explanation. The scientific method itself depends on this principle.

### Principle of Causality
Every effect must have a cause that is sufficient to explain it. Again, the scientific method itself depends on this principle, and we apply it consistently across all domains of inquiry.

### Avoiding Fallacies
We carefully identify and avoid:
- **Circular reasoning** (using what we're trying to prove)
- **Infinite regress** (endless chain of explanations)
- **Category errors** (confusing different types of things)
- **Equivocation** (switching meanings of terms)

### Precise Terminology
We use precise philosophical terms rather than loaded cultural or religious language. For example, we refer to the **"Necessary Being"** rather than culturally-specific terms (such as "God"), focusing on logical necessity rather than traditional claims.

## Fundamental Axioms

The map recognizes four types of self-evident, necessary truths that serve as axioms:

### Logical Necessity
Self-evident logical truths that cannot be otherwise, such as:
- **Law of Identity:** A = A
- **Law of Non-contradiction:** A cannot be not-A at the same time and in the same respect.
- **Law of Excluded Middle:** For any proposition P, either P is true or not-P is true.

### Mathematical Necessity
Necessary mathematical truths that follow from pure reason, such as:
- 2 + 2 = 4
- A triangle must have three sides.
- Geometric principles

### Metaphysical Necessity
Necessary truths about the nature of reality, such as:
- Effects require causes.
- Properties require substances.
- Color requires extension.

### Definitional/Analytical Necessity
Necessary truths based on the meaning of terms, such as:
- A bachelor is unmarried.
- A red apple is red.
- A part is less than the whole.

## Contribution Guidelines
