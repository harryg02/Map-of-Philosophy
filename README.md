# Map of Philosophy

A systematic exploration of philosophical arguments using strict logical analysis and necessity.

## Purpose

This repository contains a philosophical map that traces arguments to their logical foundations, following strict principles of reason while avoiding common fallacies. The goal is to analyze philosophical questions with the same rigor that we apply to mathematics and science.

## Fundamental Axioms

The map recognizes four types of self-evident, necessary truths that serve as axioms:

### Logical Necessity
Self-evident logical truths that cannot be otherwise, such as:
- Law of Identity (A = A)
- Law of Non-contradiction (A cannot be not-A)
- Law of Excluded Middle (either A or not-A)

### Mathematical Necessity 
Necessary mathematical truths that follow from pure reason, such as:
- 2 + 2 = 4
- A triangle must have three sides
- Geometric principles

### Metaphysical Necessity
Necessary truths about the nature of reality, such as:
- Effects require causes
- Properties require substances
- Color requires extension

### Definitional/Analytical Necessity
Necessary truths based on the meaning of terms, such as:
- A bachelor is unmarried
- A red apple is red
- A part is less than the whole

## Methodological Principles

### Strict Logic
All arguments must follow necessary logical connections. We avoid appeals to intuition or feeling, focusing instead on what can be demonstrated through pure reason.

### Principle of Sufficient Reason
Everything that exists must have a sufficient explanation for why it exists and why it has the properties it does. We reject arbitrary stopping points or "brute facts" that lack explanation.

### Principle of Causality 
Every effect must have a cause that is sufficient to explain it. The scientific method itself depends on this principle, and we apply it consistently across all domains of inquiry.

### Avoiding Fallacies
We carefully identify and avoid:
- Circular reasoning (using what we're trying to prove)
- Infinite regress (endless chain of explanations)
- Category errors (confusing different types of things)
- Equivocation (switching meanings of terms)

### Precise Terminology
We use precise philosophical terms rather than loaded cultural or religious language. For example, we refer to the "Necessary Being" rather than culturally-specific terms, focusing on logical necessity rather than traditional claims.

## Structure

The map traces various philosophical questions to their logical foundations by:
1. Starting with observed phenomena
2. Applying principles of sufficient reason and causality
3. Following chains of explanation to their ultimate ground
4. Identifying necessary vs contingent truths
5. Reaching logically necessary conclusions

## Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to this philosophical map:
1. Demonstrate strict logical necessity
2. Show clear chains of reasoning
3. Identify hidden assumptions
4. Use precise terminology
5. Avoid appeals to authority or tradition
